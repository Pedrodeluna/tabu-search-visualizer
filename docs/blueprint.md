# **App Name**: Tabu Search Visualizer

## Core Features:

- Objective Function Display: Display the contour plot of the objective function f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2.
- Current and Best Solution Display: Display the coordinates and objective function value for the current and best solutions.
- Step-by-Step Navigation: Move forward one step with the 'Enter' key and backward one step with the 'Backspace' key in the Tabu Search algorithm.
- Solution Visualization: Visualize the best solution, current solution, generated neighbors (5), best non-tabu neighbor, and tabu list points on the contour plot with different colors.
- Movement Indicator: Display a line connecting the current solution and the best non-tabu neighbor to indicate the next move.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep violet (#673AB7) to evoke an intellectual and sophisticated feel.
- Background color: Light grey (#F5F5F5), desaturated hue similar to the primary.
- Accent color: Teal (#009688), analogous to the violet, for highlighting interactive elements such as the best neighbor.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif providing a clean and modern feel.
- Minimalist icons to represent steps, solutions and algorithm parameters.
- Split-screen layout with the contour plot on the left and solution details on the right.
- Smooth transitions between steps with animated movement of the solution point.
